# Green-Speed-Analytics---Modelling

This is the Jupyter notebook that the main analytics of the project is located. The main dataset that was used through the entire project was loaded & analyse here. Also machine learning modelling of the data is done here and recommendations for the times where vehicle flow is lowest to minimize the carbon footprint are also given within the notebook.

The notebook was coded in python and the API was generated in Flask.
